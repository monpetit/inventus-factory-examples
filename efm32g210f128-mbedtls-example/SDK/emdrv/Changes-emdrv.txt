================ Revision history ============================================
4.3.0:
 - UARTDRV: Added support for a new flow control mode which is using the built
   in hardware flow control capabilities on platform 2 devices. The new flow
   control mode is called "uartdrvFlowControlHwUart"
 - UARTDRV: Fixed bug where tx bytes could be droppen when using the flow
   control mode called "uartdrvFlowControlHw".
 - SLEEP driver will no longer allow blocking of EM1 energy mode.
 - EZRADIODRV now supports Si4468 radio based parts.
 - Made ezradio_comm_GetResp non-blocker in EZRADIODRV.
 - Made ezradio_comm_PollCTS non-blocker if used together with GPIO1 in EZRADIODRV.
 - EZRADIODRV transmit and receive plugins use the generated channel number instead of the 0.
 - EZRADIODRV now supports 4-wire SPI mode (not available for EZR32 based devices).

4.2.1:
 - No changes.

4.2.0:
 - Added TEMPDRV, a temperature sensor driver.

4.1.1:
 - NVM Wear-Leveling driver page headers re-organized to have natural alignment.
   Reads are therefore done as as aligned accesses only. The offset of the version member in the
   header is maintained.
 - NVM driver is updated to work with SCB_CCR_UNALIGN_TRP enabled.
 - NVM driver version (in headers) incremented from 2 to 3.
 - NVMHAL code disabled by default (in #if blocks) is removed.
 - NVM driver code and documentation is updated.

4.1.0:
 - EZRADIODRV now supports the plugin system layer. Transmit, receive, CRC
   error, auto acknowledge, PN9, direct receive, direct transmit and unmodulated
   carrier plugins are added.
 - EZRADIODRV now supports Si4461 radio based parts.
 - EZRADIODRV radio API layer is reworked.
 - Updated EZRADIODRV documentation and examples.

4.0.0:
 - In GPIOINTERRUPT, fixed race condition in GPIOINT_IRQDispatcher.

3.20.13:
 - Removed obsolete include statement in EZRADIODRV.

3.20.12:
 - Changes and bugfixes in all drivers.

3.20.5:
 - Added RTCDRV and SPIDRV drivers.
 - All NVM driver configuration parameters moved to emdrv\config\nvm_config.h and nvm_config.c
 - NVM driver now uses Ecode error codes.
 - Updated NVM driver documentation and example.
 - Updated GPIOINT driver documentation.

3.20.2:
 - Added SLEEP driver.

3.20.0:
 - First version with NVM and GPIOINTERRUPT drivers.
